        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <!-- <p>
          I really enjoy teaching web development as it lends itself to personal
          growth not only from needing to learn new technologies or updating versions,
          but it also validates what I know.  Students put their trust in me and I
          learn something new every day.  Every time I teach Python or Ruby or Javascript,
          you name it, I dive a little bit deeper.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          Einstein had it right and I subscribe to his thinking that we need to learn for life.
          Not only do I like to learn for life, but I also find sharing what I know
          to be gratifying as well, in tech and in life.  Tech though, hasn't always been my labor of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          My coding career started out rough.  I got in over my head with computer science
          courses, namely Java.  It knocked me down a peg or two from my usual success and as
          a result, I put coding down and started with atmospheric science.  It was a great choice, but
          eventually I wanted to code again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since 2014, I've been back in the coding mindspace and I am over-the-moon about my choice to pick it up again.
          I've had a deeper appreciation for the code I used to struggle with and I've been exposed
          to many technologies and ideas.  It's hard for me to pin down my favorites, but I definitely
          have a soft spot for the LAMP stack, which I cut my teeth on, as well as Ruby's
          'do everything for you' mentality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the coding realm, you can most likely find me brewing a batch of beer, watching sports,
          at a concert, or fitting a video game in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've shared some of my projects that I built either as a student at Coding Dojo or freelance below.
